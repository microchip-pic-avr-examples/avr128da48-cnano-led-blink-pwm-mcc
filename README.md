# AVR128DA48 LED Blink using PWM Code Example

This repository provides a MPLAB X project with a MCC generated code example for an LED blink driven by a PWM signal. The example demonstrates how to generate a PWM signal using a timer. The output waveform is connected to the on-board LED. The PWM duty cycle value is set at 50%. For half of the period the LED is turned ON, and for the other half the LED is turned OFF.

## Summary

The demo shows how to generate a PWM signal using Timer/Counter Type A (TCA). The output of the TCA is connected to the on-board LED of the AVR128DA48 Curiosity Nano board and a waveform signal is generated.

##  How to Program the Curiosity Nano board

This chapter shows how to use the MPLAB X IDE to program an AVR速 device with an `Example_Project.X`. This can be applied for any other projects. 

1. Connect the board to the PC.

2. Open the `Example_Project.X` project in MPLAB X IDE.

3. Set the `Example_Project.X` project as main project:
  <br>Right click on the project in the **Projects** tab and click Set as Main Project.
